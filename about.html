                <h2>A Little about me!</h2>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">My name is Adam Engleman&trade;, My username is Aeondromach (Æonꝺrōmȃk if you want to get technical). I like to code, and I am pretty good at Unreal Engine if I say so myself.
                </p>
                <h3>The Lore of Warframe</h3>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">In the far, far future—where science and mysticism blur into a bizarre, bio-mechanical tapestry—an ancient civilization called the Orokin ruled the stars. Known for their radiant, golden technology and severe superiority complexes, the Orokin were technologically omnipotent, practically immortal, and profoundly feared by all lesser beings, who they mercilessly subjugated in the name of progress. However, like most hyper-advanced civilizations in fiction, the Orokin were flawed, arrogant, and frankly quite bad at maintaining any sustainable balance in the universe. They faced opposition, stagnation, and, as with any empire that climbs too high, the threat of a long and devastating fall.</p>
                <p class="description">The primary bane of the Orokin was the “Sentients,” a biomechanical race from another dimension known as the Tau System. Originally designed by the Orokin themselves as colonizing drones, the Sentients were meant to conquer distant worlds and prepare them for Orokin expansion. But, thanks to the Orokin’s oversight, the Sentients evolved into highly intelligent beings and decided they were not fans of their creators. Resilient, adaptive, and practically immune to Orokin weaponry, the Sentients returned from Tau intent on eradicating the Orokin in revenge. Thus began a brutal intergalactic war known as the Old War, with the Orokin barely holding their ground against these superior enemies.</p>
                <p class="description">Desperate for an answer, the Orokin delved into the forbidden. They discovered a mysterious energy field known as the Void—a realm of chaotic, volatile power. They experimented by sending children through it, hoping to produce supersoldiers who could rival the Sentients. Most who entered the Void were obliterated or driven mad, but a few survived, returning with inexplicable Void powers that made them superhuman. These children, dubbed the “Tenno,” possessed an otherworldly energy that could not only harm the Sentients but proved beyond the Orokin’s own technological capabilities. To harness these Tenno, the Orokin crafted the Warframes—powerful bio-mechanical suits that enhanced their powers, channeled their Void energy, and made them virtually unstoppable.</p>
                <p class="description">The Tenno, armored and empowered by Warframes, turned the tide of the Old War, annihilating the Sentient forces with brutal efficiency. But while the Orokin celebrated, they forgot that enslaving a legion of superpowered children with little to no ethical oversight might not end well. In an act shrouded in mystery and betrayal, the Tenno, for reasons either personal or manipulated, rose up against their masters in what is now known as “The Tenno Rebellion.” They assassinated the Orokin hierarchy in a swift, coordinated massacre known as the “Tenno Betrayal,” effectively ending the Orokin Empire overnight. What motivated this rebellion remains a mystery—a concoction of trauma, manipulation, and vengeance—but it left the Tenno as the universe’s most deadly and enigmatic warriors.</p>
                <p class="description">With the Orokin gone and the Sentients nearly extinct, the once-glorious Empire decayed into anarchy. The Tenno, now masterless and possibly guilt-ridden, fell into a self-imposed slumber, encased in cryopods hidden throughout the system. Time passed, and new factions arose from the remnants of the Orokin’s fractured empire, each claiming power, each flawed, and each doomed by its own hubris.</p>
                <h4>The Modern Era and the Warring Factions</h4>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">As the centuries rolled by, humanity splintered and devolved into factions driven by greed, violence, and a half-buried memory of the Orokin’s legacy. Among the major players:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: orange;">The Grineer</span> – Descendants of Orokin clones and foot soldiers, the Grineer are a militaristic, authoritarian race plagued by genetic decay and a penchant for excessive violence. Driven by their expansionist whims, the Grineer are led by the twin Queens—ancient, decrepit beings who claim divinity and govern through brute force. With decaying DNA and shortened lifespans, the Grineer compensate by enacting massive cloning programs, but this only accelerates their genetic degradation. Despite their physical decline, the Grineer maintain a massive empire and an undying grudge against the Tenno.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: aqua;">The Corpus</span> – In stark contrast to the brutal Grineer, the Corpus are a techno-corporate conglomerate with an insatiable obsession with profit. Descended from Orokin engineers and scholars, the Corpus worship technology, viewing the Orokin’s creations as holy artifacts. Led by a shadowy council known as the Board of Directors, the Corpus excel in robotics, trade, and exploitation. They rely on profit margins, greed, and the cold, calculated power of capitalism to expand their influence. However, their thirst for power often leads them to dangerous decisions, such as bargaining with the Sentients and hunting down Warframes for profit.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: orangered;">The Infested</span> – While the Grineer and Corpus are understandable, albeit misguided, human factions, the Infested are a complete anomaly. They are the Orokin’s darkest biological experiment gone awry—a grotesque plague that transforms flesh and metal alike into horrific, mutated monstrosities. Created by the Orokin to control populations through bio-warfare, the Infested now act as a self-sustaining hivemind, assimilating anything they encounter. Driven by a primal hunger, they infest ships, planets, and, occasionally, Warframes, adding a truly horrific layer of body horror to the galaxy’s threats.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: red;">The Sentients (Again)</span> – Thought eradicated, the Sentients aren’t quite dead. After the Old War, fragments of their kind survived, with a few notable leaders, like the infamous Hunhow, plotting in the shadows. Sentient agents infiltrate the factions, scheming to rebuild their forces and finish the work they began centuries ago: the complete obliteration of human and Orokin influence in the solar system. Hunhow, and later his daughter Natah (who becomes central to Tenno lore), play a critical role in manipulating events to achieve the Sentients' goal of vengeance.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: violet;">The Tenno (aka, You)</span> – With the world in chaos, the cryo-bound Tenno are slowly awakened by a mysterious figure known as “The Lotus.” Acting as a motherly guide, The Lotus trains the Tenno in the arts of war, espionage, and survival, encouraging them to wield their ancient Warframes against the various factions threatening the balance of the system. As the game unfolds, it’s revealed that The Lotus is, in fact, a Sentient agent (Natah), torn between her loyalty to the Tenno and her true nature. This conflict triggers a series of betrayals, revelations, and existential crises that deeply complicate the Tenno’s relationship with her and their understanding of themselves.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>The Quest for Identity and the Void</h4>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">Throughout their journey, the Tenno begin to uncover truths about the Void, the Orokin, and their own origin. The Void is not merely a source of power but a realm that fundamentally altered them, granting them abilities that defy explanation. The Void exposure made them “operators”—powerful, ageless children capable of transcending their Warframes and manipulating the physical world with raw Void energy. This dual nature (as both Operators and Warframe pilots) adds layers of identity crises, as the Tenno grapple with who they were, who they are, and who they were manipulated to become.</p>
                <h4>The New War</h4>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">The New War in Warframe is an epic, game-changing chapter in the story that plunges the Tenno into an all-out, galaxy-spanning conflict with the Sentients, who return with a vengeance. After years of planning and covert machinations, the Sentients—led by the dread Sentient mother Erra and her father Hunhow—mobilize a brutal assault on the Origin System, intending to destroy everything in their path and settle the ancient grudge with the Orokin’s legacy once and for all. But this time, they have an unexpected ally: Natah, known to the Tenno as The Lotus, who was initially their guide and mother figure but now reveals her true identity and purpose.</p>
                <p class="description">The New War is set in motion with a series of attacks across the system as the Sentients infiltrate planets and dismantle factions with ruthless efficiency. The Grineer and Corpus are overwhelmed, their forces outmatched by the adaptable and nearly indestructible Sentient warriors. In a bid to survive, these rival factions—longtime enemies of the Tenno—begrudgingly unite, hoping to resist the Sentients' invasion. However, these efforts are futile without the Tenno, who stand as the last line of defense against this overwhelming force.</p>
                <p class="description">As the battle intensifies, the Tenno confront the harsh reality of their leader’s betrayal. The Lotus, or rather Natah, has chosen to rejoin her Sentient family, revealing that her nurturing role with the Tenno was part of a deeper, layered plot all along. However, Natah’s past with the Tenno leaves her conflicted, and this emotional turmoil threatens to tear her apart as she is caught between duty to her people and her bond with the Tenno. Meanwhile, Erra pushes forward with his plan to assimilate and annihilate all organic life in the system, seeing the Tenno as an obstacle to be erased.</p>
                <p class="description">In a dramatic series of battles, the Tenno are drawn to a climactic confrontation on Earth, where the Sentient invasion reaches its peak. Here, the Tenno discover the devastating potential of the Sentient’s ultimate weapon, a massive construct capable of consuming entire star systems. Throughout the conflict, the Tenno experience some of their darkest trials, facing revelations about their origins, their purpose, and the very nature of the Warframes they wield. The New War forces them to confront who they really are as Operators and what it means to be a weapon forged in the crucible of the Orokin’s sins.</p>
                <p class="description">In the climactic moments, players experience a blend of perspectives, controlling not just their Warframe but even seeing through the eyes of other factions, like Grineer and Corpus soldiers, gaining a deeper understanding of the sacrifices and struggles faced by all sides. As they battle alongside unlikely allies, the Tenno experience firsthand the horrors of the Sentient invasion and the impact of their own actions across the Origin System.</p>
                <p class="description">Ultimately, the Tenno must face Natah in her full Sentient form, alongside Erra and Hunhow, in a final showdown. In a moment of crisis, the Lotus’s divided loyalties lead her to sacrifice herself to save the Tenno, severing her ties to the Sentients and choosing the family she found among the Tenno over her own bloodline. This act, however, costs her dearly, leaving her in a state of uncertainty, neither fully Sentient nor fully Orokin, and with a lingering question: what does the Lotus truly represent?</p>
                <p class="description">In the wake of the New War, the Origin System stands battered but resilient, with new alliances forged and grudges set aside (at least for now). The Tenno emerge not just as warriors but as individuals with a new understanding of themselves and their world. The Lotus, having reclaimed her place as the Tenno’s ally but no longer as their unquestionable guide, now represents something new—a figure of redemption and transformation, embodying the spirit of a universe forever changed by war. The Sentient threat has been beaten back, but the scars left by the New War will shape the Tenno, the Origin System, and its fractured factions for years to come.</p>
                <h5>The Never-Ending War</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">As it stands, the galaxy is a battlefield—a fractured remnant of the Orokin’s twisted legacy. The Tenno, awakening from their long sleep, have become wandering warriors striving to restore balance in a universe teetering on the edge of ruin. They battle against Sentient resurgence, Grineer expansion, Corpus exploitation, and the omnipresent horror of the Infested, all while confronting their own mysterious pasts and the dark truths embedded within their powers.</p>
                <p class="description">Through quests, each more bizarre and emotionally taxing than the last, the Tenno uncover layers upon layers of a cosmos ruled by cycles of betrayal, power struggles, and deeply personal battles over identity. In a universe without heroes or villains, the Tenno stand as haunted relics, wielding Warframes forged from Orokin sins and fueled by Void-born powers they barely understand. Forever warriors, forever shadows, they move forward—always fighting, always searching, but forever caught in the Orokin’s grand, broken machine.</p>
                <h4>The Man in the Wall, Wally</h4>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">The Man in the Wall is one of the most mysterious, eerie, and influential entities in Warframe, representing a cosmic force of chaos and madness lurking in the Void, forever intertwined with the Tenno. Known by many names—“the Man in the Wall,” “Wally,” or simply “It”—this enigmatic being defies easy categorization. Appearing to the Tenno as a pale, almost childlike figure with a blank, spectral face, the Man in the Wall embodies the worst elements of the Void’s influence on reality and the mind. It’s a creature of the shadows, one that never fully reveals its motives, but whose presence has haunted the Tenno since their first encounter with the Void.</p>
                <h5>Origins and Nature</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">The Man in the Wall is born of the Void itself, a realm outside space and time, full of strange, unstable energy. When the Orokin first discovered the Void, they saw it as a new source of power, one that could help them conquer distant systems like Tau and transcend the limitations of their universe. However, they underestimated its darker side: the Void is not merely a source of energy but a realm teeming with malevolent and incomprehensible forces. It is a place where reality is warped, where time bends, and where the barrier between life and death is porous. The Man in the Wall is a manifestation of this energy—a dark echo of whatever twisted chaos lives in the Void.</p>
                <p class="description">For the Tenno, the Void became part of their origin story. When the children who would become the Tenno were exposed to the Void, they came back changed, with powers that the Orokin could barely understand. But alongside these powers, they also brought back a piece of the Void itself—an echo of something else, something watching, something waiting. The Man in the Wall became linked to them from that point on, perhaps attracted by their potential, perhaps even birthed by their trauma. It appears whenever the Void exerts influence, an ever-present reminder of the darkness the Tenno can never truly escape.</p>
                <h5>The Man in the Wall’s Role in the Tenno’s Life</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">Unlike most threats, the Man in the Wall is not one that can be fought, bargained with, or reasoned with. It exists more as a specter, a reminder of the horror and power of the Void that the Tenno are forever bound to. At times, it seems to appear out of pure mischief, taunting the Tenno with cryptic messages, surreal visions, and disturbing imagery. It appears suddenly and unexpectedly, often in reflections, or staring from behind walls and corners, only to vanish in a flash. Yet, its taunts are not mere pranks; they push the Tenno toward existential and emotional crises, hinting at terrible truths about the Void, the Tenno’s purpose, and their cursed bond with Warframes.</p>
                <p class="description">The Man in the Wall’s influence is strongest in moments of turmoil. It appears during crises, wars, and pivotal moments in the Tenno’s journey, especially when they encounter the true depths of the Void. For instance, it appears during The War Within and The Sacrifice, directly interacting with the Tenno as if it has been waiting for these turning points. It knows the Tenno’s secrets, their fears, and their past. Even more disturbingly, it seems to relish those moments when they are most vulnerable. The Man in the Wall acts as an unwanted companion, a figure lurking in the shadows of the Tenno’s psyche, ready to exploit their trauma or steer them toward paths that might feed its own mysterious goals.</p>
                <h5>Is the Man in the Wall Friend, Foe, or Something Else?</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">The Man in the Wall’s motivations remain obscure and possibly unknowable. It often claims to “help” the Tenno, offering them guidance in the form of eerie advice, visions, or strange gifts. For instance, it grants the Tenno the Riven Mods, items of immense power but shadowed by an enigmatic connection to the Void. These mods help the Tenno grow stronger, but they also come with a price—a reminder of the Man in the Wall’s influence over them. At times, it seems like it wants the Tenno to succeed, to become more powerful, as though their victories are also its own. However, it’s equally likely that it sees them as mere playthings, subjects to toy with, and instruments for its own amusement.</p>
                <p class="description">There are also moments when it hints that the Tenno are more similar to it than they might want to admit. The Tenno, after all, have been altered by the Void and are haunted by its power. The Man in the Wall suggests that the Tenno’s powers and their very existence may be owed to entities like itself. In a way, it seems to view the Tenno as children of the Void—a fractured reflection of its own nature, granted the ability to wield powers only it could truly understand. Yet, unlike the Tenno, who are often bound by duty and conscience, the Man in the Wall is a creature of total freedom, one that encourages the Tenno to let go of their inhibitions and embrace the darker, primal aspects of their power.</p>
                <h5>Major Encounters with the Man in the Wall</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description"></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: red;">The War Within:</span> In this quest, the Tenno confront their own internal fears, rage, and trauma, unlocking powerful new abilities. The Man in the Wall appears to encourage this journey of self-discovery, whispering to the Tenno and nudging them toward embracing the harsher aspects of their power.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: white;">The Sacrifice:</span> When searching for their lost companion, the Warframe Umbra, the Tenno experiences visions and insights driven by the Man in the Wall’s manipulative influence. This encounter raises more questions about whether the Man in the Wall is connected to the Warframes, seeing as Umbra is haunted by memories of pain and betrayal, emotions that the Man in the Wall relishes.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="description"><span style="color: orange;">Chains of Harrow:</span> In this chilling quest, the Man in the Wall appears to haunt not only the Tenno but also Rell, a former Tenno with severe emotional scars who was driven to create his own Warframe, Harrow, as a kind of containment vessel for his fractured mind. This quest reveals that the Man in the Wall has been with the Tenno since their origins, suggesting that its reach extends far beyond a single Operator and may encompass all Tenno.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <h5>The Man in the Wall and The Tenno’s Future</h5>
                <hr>
                <p class="description">The Man in the Wall represents the most unsettling aspects of the Void, and by extension, the unknowns that even the Tenno don’t fully understand about themselves. As the Tenno’s powers grow and their role in the Origin System evolves, the Man in the Wall grows increasingly prominent, hinting that it has a greater plan or purpose for them—one that they may not be able to escape. It is as if this creature wants them to become something, but what that “something” is remains shrouded in uncertainty.</p>
                <p class="description">Though it has yet to reveal its full intentions, the Man in the Wall has shaped the Tenno’s journey at every step, showing an almost parental fascination mixed with something far more sinister. Is it a harbinger of chaos? A deity of the Void? Or simply a twisted mirror reflecting the darker side of the Tenno’s power and potential? The Man in the Wall leaves the Tenno with one unavoidable truth: they can never fully escape the Void. It is part of them, and so, too, is he.</p>
                <p class="description">In the end, the Man in the Wall is both warning and promise, a figure that forces the Tenno to confront the uncomfortable truth that they are bound to something beyond understanding, beyond morality, and perhaps, beyond their own control. Whatever path the Tenno choose, it will likely have been subtly guided by this specter, whose unseen hand shapes both their nightmares and their triumphs.</p>
